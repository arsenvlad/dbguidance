Hadoop Ecosystem
==========================
Choosing between HDInsight, various 3rd-party Hadoop distributions for IaaS, and other Hadoop ecosystem decisions.

**Note: This guidance is still under development**

###Questions to think about:

 - **When should you strongly consider using HDInsight instead of managing my own Hadoop cluster?**

 - **Are you planning to run your Hadoop cluster in the cloud, on-premises, or both/hybrid?**

 - **Will your Hadoop cluster be always-on or will you use it periodically?**

 - **Where will you store the data? (e.g. on premises, in Azure blob storage, in another cloud)**

 - **What are your performance targets? Data volume, number of nodes, etc.**

 - **What are you security requirements?**

 - **Are you coming from a Windows or Linux background?**

 - **If you want to run and manage my own Hadoop cluster, how do you decide which Hadoop distribution to use (e.g. Cloudera, Hortonworks, or MapR)?**

 - **What are the key differentiators between different Hadoop distributions? For example, MapR offers its own unique file system.**

 - **When should you use Hive and when should you look into Spark?**
